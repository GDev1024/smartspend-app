## 🎯 Problem Statement  

Many college students receive daily or weekly allowances but struggle to manage their money responsibly. Without proper tracking tools:  

- Small expenses add up unnoticed  
- Savings goals are inconsistent  
- No visibility into spending patterns  
- Manual tracking is time-consuming and error-prone  

SmartSpend solves this by automating financial tracking using data structures covered in our course.
